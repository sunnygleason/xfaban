/**
 * Designates a method to be called only once, just before the start of the

 * No other thread will be started until this method finishes. Note that only
 * one method is allowed for the OnceBefore designation. If Faban finds more
 * than one method with the OnceBefore annotation, it will throw a

 * The OnceBefore and OnceAfter annotations are used mainly for auditing
 * the state of the SUT before and after the benchmark run. A CustomMetrics
