/**
 * This class is used to load multiple HTTP requests, emulating
 * a browser. It is configured with a number of threads, and requests are
 * loaded simultaneously by those threads.
 *
 * Typical usage of this class:
 * <pre>
 *    MultipleTransport mt = new MultipleTransport(2);
 *    mt.addURL("http://myhost/index.html");
 *    mt.addURL("http://myhost/image1.gif");
 *    mt.addURL("http://myhost/image2.gif");
 *    mt.addURL("http://myhost/image3.gif");
 *    mt.addURL("http://myhost/image4.gif");
 *    boolean success = mt.waitForAll();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Nothing is actually loaded until the waitForAll() method is called. When
 * that method is called, the first URL is loaded (hence, the first URL is
 * typically the page URL) in the calling thread. Subsequently, the remaining
 * URLs (typically images and other resources) are loaded by the calling
 * thread and the threads created by this class. The total number of
 * simultaneous threads is specified by the constructor of this class, but
 * that includes the calling thread: that creates a more efficient thread
 * usage.
 *
 * After calling the waitForAll() method, the MultipleTransport is reset and
 * can be reused to load a new set of requests; if the requests are loaded
 * from the same host, then the keep-alive semantics of the HTTP transport
 * will be used.
 *
 * When finished with this object, you should call its close() method to
 * terminate its threads; otherwise the threads will leak. I have chosen
 * not to add a finalizer to this class to close the threads, since that
 * particular operation is known to cause issues with the garbage collector.
 *
 * TODO: Need a way to retrieve individual URL status
