/**
 * The MatrixMix allows describing the transition probabilities of a finite
 * Markov chain as a right stochastic matrix (or just "stochastic matrix").
 * This must be a square matrix. Each row represents a probability vector for
 * transitioning from an operation (row operations index) to an operation
 * (column operations index). Members must be non-negative numbers.
 * To avoid human errors, Faban does not require each specified row to sum up
 * to 1 but will automatically normalize each row to 1 (or 100%) prior to
 * starting the load generation.<p>
 *
 * The MatrixMix  annotation interface describes the parameters
 * required when defining a matrix mix. The MatrixMix annotation
 * will need to be used in conjunction with the BenchmarkDriver
 * annotation. Otherwise this annotation will be ignored.<p>
 * 
 * Note that the mix in the BenchmarkOperation annotation is ignored
 * when a benchmark is specified to use MatrixMix.
