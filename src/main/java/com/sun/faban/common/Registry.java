/**
 * The methods in this interface are the public face of Registry
 * The Registry is the single remote object that runs on the master
 * machine and with which all other instances of remote servers reregister.
 * A remote reference to any remote service is obtained by the GUI as 
 * well as the Engine through the registry. There is only one remote server
 * object (the Registry) that is on the master machine. Once a reference to
 * the Registry is obtained by the client, it should use the
 * 'getReference' method to obtain a reference to any type of
 * remote server.<p>
 *
 * Although the Registry implementation uses rmi underneath, the rmi registry
 * is fully encapsulated inside the Registry and RegistryLocator to avoid any
 * confusion in the agent programs and other programs accessing the registry.
